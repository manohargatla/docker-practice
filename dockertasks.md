* Explain what happens when you run the docker container?
  * The docker run command creates running containers from images and can run commands inside them.When using the docker run command, a container can run a default action (if it has one), a user specified action, or a shell to be used interactively.

* Explain docker architecture?
  * Docker architecture. Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon.
